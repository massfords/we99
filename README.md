# Heilmeier's Catechism

George Heilmeier was a special assistant to the Secretary of Defense as well as a
scientist, inventor, and engineer. He liked to begin projects by asking the
following questions. Failure to provide good answers was a good sign that the
project was either not ready to receive funding.

## What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon.
We are building a tool for use by biologists to assist in the preparation of
experiments and the analysis of the results.
## How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
There is a mix of manual and automated systems, but neither scales well or
provides good tooling for this domain. There are some tools available but they
don't scale well financially due to their high per user licensing cost.
## What's new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
We'll provide a central repository for components of the experiments and user
friendly tools to manage different configurations. It will be successful since
scientists are in need to tools specific to this domain that automate their
workflow.
## Who cares?
Biologists that have little to no tooling or are lacking big budgets to buy
existing tools will care. Big-pharma will care because it could reduce the cost
of new drug development by accelerating the workflows that screen the components
for possible new drugs.
## If you're successful, what difference will it make?
Eliminating compounds earlier in the discovery cycle saves millions of dollars.
## What are the risks and the payoffs?
Primary risk is attempting to overreach in 1.0 or our version of 1.0. The payoffs
are that we all get an A.
## How much will it cost?
~ 200 man hours
## How long will it take?
12 weeks
## What are the midterm and final "exams" to check for success?
Midterm exam is the presentation of our Statement of Work (SOW).
Final exam is the presentation to the faculty panel. Our system must work as
described in the SOW.
