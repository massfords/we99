# This is a sparse CSV. We don't need to define entries for every single cell.
# The PlateMap import code will look at the max dimension and determine which
# PlateTypes are eligible. If there aren't any eligible PlateTypes, then perhaps
# the system could create a one-off for just this map and let the user fill in
# the type details later.
